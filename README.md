# Gulp & Less static boilerplate

Just that. More than sufficient for prototyping static pages. Uses Bootstrap. Batteries not included. Not suitable for children aged three or less.

## User's manual

Fire up `gulp` to start an Express server at `localhost:8080`. 
Upon start and changes custom scripts and libraries get `uglify`'ed and other assets copied to `build` directory, and `livereload` takes care of updating your view whenever you hit that big Save button.
